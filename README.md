# OpenSnips



## Overview

This project is home to a number of open source projects related to the Snips voice platform.

- <b>[snips-react-satellite](./snips-react-satellite/README.md) </b> - React component to add a microphone button to a web page that streams mqtt audio to Snips. Implements hotword,audioserver,tts and skill-server components of the Snips mqtt hermes protocol.

- collection of assistants including meekahome music player

- TODO. opensnips 100% open source implementation in nodejs of the snips hermes protocol using kaldi asr and rasa nlu.
Previous sample implementation developed in python has been archived.

- docker images for snips, nodejs, mosquitto

- docker-compose suite to run example


## Quickstart

Install docker
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ sudo sh get-docker.sh
apt-get install docker-compose
```

Run the example
```
git clone https://github.com/syntithenai/opensnips.git
docker-compose up &

```
Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see the microphone demo.

The opensnips repository includes a snips assistant for meekahome that supports the example AppServer intents.

## PulseAudio

If you are developing on Linux it is useful to have multiple access to the sound card by using pulse audio.

The docker compose file shows a container can use  pulseaudio on the Linux host.

- Run paprefs and enable network server. 
- Possibly also update volume mount to cookie file (if not anon access) and PULSE_HOST to 
Linux IP address.

The snips image is built with alsa and pulse config compatible with the environment variables from the docker-compose file.

!! If you have a (playstation eye) microphone plugged into a always on usb power port, it may not reset on reboot and end up jammed. Switch usb ports (and reboot) to fix.
